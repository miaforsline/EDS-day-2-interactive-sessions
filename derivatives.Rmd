#Derivatives in R

```{r}
fx <- expression(x^2)
#expression command tells R x^2 is not a value 

df_dx <- D(expr = fx, name = "x") 
#name = the variable to take the derivative with respect to (important for multivariate derivatives)

df_dx

#Evaluate the slope of f(x) at x = 831

x <- 831 
eval(expr = df_dx) #evaluates the expression based on what value we assigned x
```

```{r}
gt <- expression (3 * t^2 * 4 * cos(t))
dg_dt <- D(expr = gt, name = "t") #take derivative w/respect to t

gx <- expression(2*x^2)
dg_dx <- D(expr = gx, name = "x")
x <- seq(from = -10, to = 10, by = 0.5) 
eval(expr = dg_dx)
#We can also evaluate derivatives by a sequence of numbers - aka the slopes of the tangent lines of the function from -10 to +10 by 0.5 increments 
```
